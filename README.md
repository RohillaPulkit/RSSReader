Project Contribution:
	
	Our project group consists of two members. We have equally shared the implementation work of the application. One of the team member has worked on the Add content page, and the other has worked on the New post page. One of us has implemented the serial download and the other has implemented the parallel download. Both have done their share in the Database and GUI implementation as well as documentation. Also, the other functionalities were split among the two and each one has done their part of the project.


Project Description:
	
	We have developed an application for RSS Reader. The application contains a total of 9 categories with each category having 4-5 RSS Feeds. The user has an option to choose the categories whose feeds must be downloaded. There are two options for downloading, serial download and parallel download. Also, we have provided two features ‘read later’ and ‘favourite’ for each feed. We have compared the two download methods using two parameters, time required for download and memory and CPU utilization.
